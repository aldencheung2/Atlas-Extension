# Atlas Extension

Atlas extension is a Chrome extension that adds ratemyprofessors.com and LSA Course Guide info to UMich Atlas course pages. Currently, it adds the following to course pages:

- A link to search for past syllabi
- LSA Distribution Requirement areas (e.g. Social Science/SS, Humanities/HU, Mathematical and Symbolic Analysis/MSA, etc.)
- A more detailed course description pulled from the LSA Course Guide
- The instructor teaching each section, if not already listed
- Each professor's would take again rating, difficulty rating, and overall rating
- A link to view reviews for each professor
